## ✨ Why This Project?

Campus life can be chaotic — long queues at the mess, lost belongings, and missing scholarship deadlines. We asked ourselves:

> ❓ *“What if technology could solve all that?”*

And that’s exactly what we built — a **one-stop solution** to empower students and streamline their day-to-day campus experiences.
